                    <p> <strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 review: the best Android tablet 2-in-1</strong><p><span>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 can replace your laptop — if you're willing to put up with some quirks and don't rely heavily on specific desktop apps to get the job done. I checked out this new 2-in-1 tablet on practice.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The device is expensive, costing about $ 830 (53.5 thousand rubles) with a keyboard, designed for a niche group of people who are looking for an alternative to an Android laptop. It is not just a tablet for games and watching movies, but a device on which you can perform some work. This is a Galaxy Tab S6 baby!</span></p><div><div></div></div><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Read also:</b></span><span> </span><span></span><a>Apple iPad Air 2019 review: an updated and versatile tablet</a></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Design and comfort</span></h2><p><span>Galaxy Tab S6 small enough to fit even in some of my smallest bags, and lightweight at the same time. Despite the fact that the front panel here is thin with a 10.5-inch screen, there is still enough space to hold the tablet in your hand without touching the display. However, there were times when I wanted to have a larger panel, especially when multitasking in DeX mode. It's a pity that Samsung doesn't offer a different size as Apple does in its iPad Pro line.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>When compared to the iPad Pro, the Tab S6 bears a resemblance to the 11-inch model. There are few differences in the large rectangular parts, as well as the same front panels. The design of the rear parts of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 are made of durable aluminum, so the device will not break, even if it is accidentally dropped.</span></p><p><span>The S Pen is attached to the back? Yes. On the back, where the S Pen rests, there is an oblong groove that effectively holds the stylus in place, using strong magnets. In addition, if you are using a stand-up case, the it also has a recess. This place serves not only for storage, but also for recharging the S Pen.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Samsung follows the example of Apple, which last year made it so that you can put an Apple Pencil on the top edge of the iPad Pro, held through magnets, for safe storage and wireless charging. I must admit that Apple's implementation is better. The S Pen storage slot is located behind the tablet, making it difficult to find it. The Apple Pencil only has one side flat, so it's easy to see that it's attached to the tablet. Both sides of the Samsung S Pen are flat, and the right side that we need is indicated only by the symbol. This is not best solution.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The Galaxy Tab S6 tablet is available in grey, blue or pink. The keyboard cover is not included in the kit, but it is worth purchasing it despite the high price of $ 179 (11.5 thousand rubles.). I was working on this 2-in-1 hybrid tablet while sitting on my lap in the at the airport, in the Park, and on the plane. And I've never been embarrassed. Here it is very easy to adjust the stand on the back panel, which can not be said about the iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard from Apple.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The fingerprint sensor is hidden under the display, but it does not use ultrasonic technology technology similar to the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. It's optical, so it's not as secure or reliable, although I didn't have much trouble with it. Instead, I used the face unlock feature. However, it is not as secure, effective as Apple Face ID and has difficulties with weak lighting.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Screen and multimedia</span></h2><p><span>Super AMOLED screen on Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 is beautiful and bright. Everything is perfectly readable, even when I was editing texts in a street cafe, on a bright Sunny day. Any content here looks clear thanks to the resolution 2560×1600.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The colors are rich, and the blacks are as dark as night. Dim scenes in the video are easily distinguishable due to the high brightness. There is also support for HDR10+, if you watch movies in HDR, you will get additional contrast. I've enjoyed episodes of Netflix series that they look fantastic on this tablet.</span></p><p><span>AKG's four-speaker acoustic system completes this statement. It delivers clear and dynamic sound, making the Galaxy Tab S6 an excellent entertainment system. However, we don't have a 3.5 mm headphone Jack. This is a disappointing omission Samsung.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Keyboard and S Pen</span></h2><p><span>The individual keys of a deep-stroke keyboard, however, in my opinion they could be a little larger. They also don't have backlighting, and it was difficult for me to type in the dark. However we get a more enjoyable experience, what does Apple's smart keyboard offer, where the keys are so thin that they are barely noticeable.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The trackpad here is excellent. It is very helpful when navigating through the software (especially in DeX mode) when you don't want to move your finger across the screen. unfortunately, text selection is not as intuitive as double-tapping, in most apps. You can also swipe up and down with two fingers on the trackpad to scroll through apps, which is convenient.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>With the S Pen, aerial actions are possible, as in the Note 10, with their help you can run certain actions in certain applications, such as the camera. They work well, but I didn't have much need for it.</span></p><p><span>I liked writing notes with a stylus, here the experience is better than that of the Galaxy Note 10. The screen is larger, so there is more space for entries. Although the technology for non-speech recognition the palms of your hands have improved, but you should still make sure that they don't touch the edges of the display. This activates the scroll bar in the Samsung Notes app, which in turn causes the S Pen to malfunction.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>If your handwriting is legible, the Notes app will automatically decipher it add it to the printed text. Formatting will take a bit of work, but it does a good job of transcribing. If you like to write notes by hand, it speeds up transcription a lot.</span></p><h2><span>Galaxy Tab S6 Cameras</span></h2><p><span>Of all the cameras on laptops and tablets, I only use the front-facing camera for video calls. The front 8-megapixel sensor of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 does not disappoint, offering a resolution of 1920×1080. The shooting quality is good, with sufficient light, but grainy when it's bad.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Although I don't take photos from my tablet, many users do. Samsung reported that 86% of Galaxy Tab S4 owners used the camera daily. What is my experience? The main 13-megapixel camera is capable of producing detailed, colorful photos that are sometimes too rich. At night, the quality of shooting drops noticeably, but the results remain acceptable.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>To add versatility, Samsung has installed a wide-angle 5-megapixel lens on the back, for different perspectives in photos. The 123-degree field of view covers most of the scene, and the sensor is surprisingly accurate in providing more accurate images natural colors than the main lens. Unfortunately, the quality is not very high, even in sufficient light.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Iron performance</span></h2><p><span>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 tablet did not disappoint with its performance either. The gadget runs on a processor, installed in most of this year's flagship Android phones: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855. The model I tested had 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory, as well as a MicroSD card slot in case you need more data space (8 GB of RAM and 256 GB are available ROM).</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Even when opening multiple tabs in Samsung's Internet browser and app Windows above each other, Tab S6 didn't slow down. Apps were launched quickly and resized instantly, as were games like Alto's Odyssey, Pako: Forever, and Grand Mountain, which ran without any problems stammerings'.</span></p><p><span><b>Here are some test results:</b></span></p><ul><li><span>AnTuTu 3DBench: 352 209.</span></li><li><span>3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 4819 Vulkan, 5395 OpenGL.</span></li><li><span>Geekbench 5 CPU: 725 single-core; 2392 multi-core.</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The results are on par with other devices on Snapdragon 855, although the numbers from Geekbench are lower (this may be a Geekbench error, since users on the network reported problems after updating the app). AnTuTu's score is not as high as that of the iPad Air, but close to it. However, the results of synthetic tests do not always indicate real performance. In practice, the Galaxy Tab S6 will delight you its speed and responsiveness.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Operation and DeX mode</span></h2><p><span>Samsung has moved forward, because Google does not yet have a desktop mode for Android, by adding a system tray in the lower right corner with access to notifications, navigation buttons, and an app drawer. In the leftist in the lower corner, we have apps that can be resized.</span></p><p><span>Not all Android apps can be changed, even if you "force" them by configuring the software. Instagram is a Prime example of this. However, posting to Instagram with the Galaxy Tab S6 is a process I've never done before faced. Although this is possible on other tablets, everything is much easier here, thanks to DeX.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Only minor quirks distract from the common desktop. Pressing the search button on your keyboard opens the app window, but you need to type twice a letter to start searching for. A quick Alt-tab click to switch to the previous application is also not smooth. The trick is to press and hold Alt, then slowly press Tab, which seems confusing.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The highlight was an Internet browser from Samsung, which turns out to be surprisingly necessary. It almost always displays the full version of websites, unlike Chrome, which shows the mobile version. I wrote this review on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, and since text selection works using a trackpad in Google Docs, it worked easily and without complications. I could place two tabs on the Internet next to each other on the split screen when typing. Here it is easy to move applications or resize Windows to view others at the same time.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Of course, I wasn't able to work as fast as on a normal laptop, but I replaced mine quite successfully laptop for the last few weeks and it was a nice and comfortable experience. I will note that my work revolves around using the browser, Google Docs, and everything else. If you rely on other services or apps, make sure that you have an Android app (or an alternative) available in advance. For example, I used Lightroom CC on S6 to edit some photos with S Pen.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Day of offline operation</span></h2><p><span>Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 will help you survive a hard working day. I used it on the plane for four hours straight, and the battery charge dropped to 60%. Add a few more hours for use in a hotel room, and the tablet is drained up to 30% earlier than going to bed.</span></p><p><span>If you plan to use this device without interruption from 9 to 17 hours, the Galaxy Tab S6 will survive, but only if you do not play or use programs that intensively load the processor. I had a similar experience with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Although the performance here is good, it doesn't quite match Samsung's claim of 15 hours of autonomy.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>In a standard battery test when playing a video, when I was playing a YouTube video in 1080p over Wi-Fi with maximum screen brightness, Tab S6 lasted 11 hours and 1 minute. This is better than the more affordable iPad Air, which fell asleep after 6 hours and 17 minutes. I think most will be more than satisfied with the S6's battery life. Energy replenishment is not very fast, and it will take you just over 2 hours to go from 0 to 100%.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>The price of Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, availability, and warranty</span></h2><p><span>Galaxy Tab S6, Samsung offers at a price of 649 $ (42 thousand rubles.), if you choose a model with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory.
